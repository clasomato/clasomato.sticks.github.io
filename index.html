      "Hamish arrived to quote when he said he would, provided a very competitive price
      and did the work ahead of time. There was an unscheduled increase in price for remedial
      work but again, it was a very reasonable price. Communication was consistently ahead of the game - no chasing
      required. Clean up was good".  Adrian.

      Stones Construction, to do my landscaping was a great choice, such a nice chap and able
      to see a vision of what can be done using the contours. Very helpful competitively priced
      and really made dreams come true to create a very useful space out of nothing.
      Very pleased, will certainly use Hamish and his team again for stage 2.” Brian
